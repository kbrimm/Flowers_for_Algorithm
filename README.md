### What is it?

This code emulates a rat in a maze using a combination of Dijkstra's algorithm and a state-based artificial intelligence engine. The simulation begins with a scientist placing a rat in a maze, thereby initializing its needs (fun, health, hunger, and sleep). The rat then makes a series of trips through the maze to satisfy its needs. When all needs are suitably satisfied, it returns to the entrance for release.

Flowers for Algorithm is, admittedly, a school project (and a fairly simple one at that). I created it as part of a lower-division CS computational structures class. I'm choosing to include it here because it still makes me smile when I run it, and sometimes computer science feels way too serious.
